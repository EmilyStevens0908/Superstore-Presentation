# Superstore-Presentation
Superstore Presentation (TripleTen)

1. What is Causing Returns?
	
 		Make the Returned field into a calculated field where the null values are 0 and the Yes values are 1. 
		Do sales always correlate positively with returns?
		Find the rate of return
		Create a geographical map for rate of return
		The return rate by some measure of time (month, week, etc.) to see if there is a seasonal effect to returned orders
		Two different kinds of composite charts showing the return rate for a mix of multiple factors (date/geography/product category/etc.)

2. Building a Dashboard for Monitoring Returns
   
		Create a template for the dashboard using empty containers to match your mock-ups.
		Take a screenshotâ€¦ You'll submit this along with the rest of the project files.
		Add your worksheets to the dashboard template.
		Finalize the dashboards with relevant markers, images, and titles as needed. Submit your mock-up, template, and finalized dashboard.

3. Presenting Your Analysis and Dashboard

	 	Construct your story arc for your presentation
   
		1. Create a draft of your story using only captions for each Story Point. Create a duplicate of your draft story (captions only) to 			submit. The draft Story should include:
		A summary of your analysis of returns
		How should returns be measured? Is the return rate, the total cost of returns or the total number of returns a better measure? When 			is one better than the other?
		What are the key root causes of returns?
		An overview of each component of your Dashboard
		Explain what is contained in each chart and how the chart should be interpreted
		A demonstration of how the Dashboard should be used
		Demonstrate how to interpret the Dashboard and how to use filters to identify root causes
		Describe actions that can be taken after using the Dashboard to identify the root causes
		A conclusion with proposed next steps (e.g., implementation of Dashboard)

		2. Add content to your Story Points
		Use the worksheets you already created and create new worksheets you might need to support your Story Arc
		Construct Dashboards to create presentation style slides
